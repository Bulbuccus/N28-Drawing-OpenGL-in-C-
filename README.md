During my Second Year(2022-2023), 2nd Semester for my Bachelor's in Computer Science(Multimedia and Graphic) 
I took a subject called Fundamental Graphic Programming where I further explore C++ language and introduced to OpenGL library

The first assignment was to draw any scenery in the campus to showcase what we've learned and I was a poor student that didn't complete this task on time.
I contected the lecturer if I could still submit my work even a few days after the deadline even wiht penalty marks so I decided to go for a simple head front view of the faculty building.
N28 Faculty of Computing

I spent two full days compiling up Visual Studio 2022 for a console application to draw in 2D writing lines after lines and calculating accurate coordinates.
 I've never been so focused and invested in something in my life.
Saving this to my github profile so I could remind myself of my accomplishment even though coding is a painful experience for me at that time.
